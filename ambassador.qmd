## SIT Ambassador

As an ambassador, I have the opportunity to get involved in many kinds of events. 

Firstly, I have the chance to attend the student leader appreciation night.

During the dinner, we have the chance to interact with the school leaders and other student leaders. It was a great opportunity to learn from them and also to network with them!
